## v3.0.25

### Breaking Change!

Password store format changed, up until now, password saved as the hash being send to the API,

To allow the enhanced functionality added, to edit Credentials and API Type, the password is now being saved encrypted and decrypted in 2 flows:

1. Edit integration details
2. On startup (hashed and sent to the API)

As result of that process, you need to re-setup the integration.

### Changes

- Add to set up configuration form new field of title to define the name of the integration

## v3.0.13

- Add API Type drop-down to configuration (Aqua Temp, Hitemp, Aqua Temp [=<1.5.8])
- Update authentication process

## v3.0.12
